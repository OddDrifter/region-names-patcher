**Unique Region Names for Synthesis** is meant to be a drop in replacement for the **Unique Region Names** mod and its many patches.

# But why?
[Unique Region Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56452) is a mod for **Skyrim Special Edition** the replaces the generic *Skyrim* label on exterior locations with more specific ones. The problem with including it in a modded load order is that it has to be patched for compatibility with many mods that modify the exterior worldspace (which is a lot of them, it could even be all of them).

**Unique Regions for Synthesis** simplifies this whole process by copying the region records from the original mod and applying them on top of an already complete load order.
